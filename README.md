## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You need a Google account to set up a Firebase project.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
    ```

2.  **Set up Firebase:**
    * Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    * Click on "Add project" and create a new project.
    * Once the project is created, click on the "Web" icon (`</>`) to add a web app to your project.
    * Register the app and Firebase will provide you with a `firebaseConfig` object. Copy this object.
    * Go to the "Build" section in the left-hand menu and select **Firestore Database**. Click "Create database" and start in **test mode** for easy setup.

3.  **Configure the Application:**
    * Open the `HI.HTML` file.
    * Find the `firebaseConfig` constant within the `<script>` tag (around line 436).
    * Replace the placeholder values with the configuration object you copied from your Firebase project.
    ```javascript
    const firebaseConfig = {
        apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
        authDomain: "YOUR_PROJECT.firebaseapp.com",
        projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
        storageBucket: "YOUR_PROJECT.appspot.com",
        messagingSenderId: "YOUR_SENDER_ID",
        appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
    };
    ```

4.  **Run the Application:**
    * Simply open the `HI.HTML` file in your web browser. No web server or build process is needed.
